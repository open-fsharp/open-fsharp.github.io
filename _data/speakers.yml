          <p>Sometimes it feels like Functional Programmers speak in a different language.
          They use complicated words, arcane math terms, and it isn't immediately obvious why any of what they talk about matters for day-to-day work.
          Here's a talk that tries to address that, and show how FP concepts apply to "normal" programming.</p>
          <p>In this talk, John will walk you through how FP concepts relate to the humble `for` loop, will show you how to use FP building blocks to simplify and strengthen your code, and finally talk about how the art of origami relates to FP.
          There will be <strong>exactly one</strong> slide, at the end of the deck, with traditional FP terminology and scary words - just so you can relate the talk to more advanced material presented elsewhere.
          But otherwise, all jargon used will be familiar to a C#, C++ or Java programmer! That said, this is an intermediate level talk, and quite a few advanced concepts will be disguised in familiar form.</p>

          <p>In this talk for F# beginners, I'll present the most common tools that can be found in a functional programmer's toolkit: tools such as "compose", "reduce", "map", "return", "apply", and "bind". What are they? Why are they important? How are they used in practice? And how do they relate to computation expressions and scary sounding concepts like monoids, monads, and functors?</p>

        <p>
            Functional programming and domain-driven design might not seem to be a good match, but in fact functional programming can be an excellent approach to designing decoupled, reusable systems with a rich domain model.  This workshop will show you why.
        </p>
        <p>
            This will be a hands-on workshop designed for beginners in F#. We'll do lots of domain modeling exercises starting with some simple models and then enhancing them with constraints, state machines, error handling, commands and events, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll cover these topics in detail:
            <ul>
                <li>The core concepts of functional programming and how they can be applied to Domain Driven Design</li>
                <li>How to represent the nouns and verbs of a domain ("the ubiquitous language") using types.</li>
                <li>Why representing the domain model using types is better than most other documentation (hint: it can never get out of sync)</li>
                <li>How to capture constraints and business rules in the domain model itself instead of being buried in the implementation</li>
                <li>How to represent state transitions</li>
                <li>How to treat errors as a part of the domain</li>
                <li>How to build a complete business workflow from smaller components using composition</li>

          <p>Over the last few years Ionide has become one of the most important projects in F# ecosystem. It's used by thousands of users, listed on official Microsoft webpage about F#, suggested as one of the starting points with F# in the official documentation. And, what's most important, it's loved and supported by the community - either by contributions to source code and documentation, positive comments on the VSCode marketplace or support on Open Collective.</p>
          <p>In this talk, I'd like to make a walkthrough Ionide's history - from the lucky chain of events that resulted in Ionide's creation almost 5 years ago, through the difficult process of making Ionide serious IDE, to working on it full time. And talk about its future...</p>
          <p>It's also my personal story - about young and naive software developer creating his first OSS project, about his growth as a developer and as a person, about burn out and stress, about both positive and negative aspects of maintaining popular OSS project.</p>

            In this session, you will learn to build and deploy distributed systems combining the power of Akka.Net, the flexibility of F# and the simplicity of Docker containers. The combination of these technologies enhances the effects of F# “code-quotation”, which allows the deployment of arbitrary Actors into remote Actor-Systems. You will learn the basic concepts behind Microservices implemented using the Actor and Actor Clustering, and how to leverage Docker containers for easy deployment. Docker provides an isolated environment for the applications running inside the container image. Akka.Net is a framework to build concurrent, resilient, distributed and scalable software systems. The cluster feature lets you distribute your Actors across multiple machines to achieve load balancing, fail-over and the ability to scale up and out.

          During this session, we will build and deploy an Actor Cluster to distribute an image processing using multiple machines.

        abstract: |
          <p>Over the past several years, we have seen a resurgence of interest in functional programming languages, particularly with the success of Scala and R in the marketplace. Although object-oriented (oo) design remains the dominant software development paradigm, even oo-first languages have seen a shift toward the functional mindset with the emphasis on LINQ in C# and lambdas in Java. This move toward a functional style should be particularly welcome for data platform specialists, who already have a leg up in understanding functional programming concepts thanks to their work with SQL.</p>
          <p>In this talk, we will focus on one functional programming language, F#. We will look at some of the basics of the language and see how you can translate knowledge of SQL into a pipeline-driven functional programming language. We will also see areas where F# integrates smoothly with SQL, creating a powerful way to extend your SQL skills beyond queries.</p>

            What are some options?
            I’ll talk about some tools we’ve built using both WebSharper and Fable that allow us to take the same code we run on thousands of machines and flexibly scale it down to web browsers.
            This will cover: Web Workers for parallelism, taking existing external C++ running as WebAssembly, and how to tie it all together productively from F# running in-browser.

            Storing history rather than current state, Event Sourcing is a radical technique to implement Domain-Driven Design efficiently. But many stop before even trying, convinced of the difficulty to implement it.
            The workshop will teach how to implement Event Sourcing. The functional approach leads to a simple, clear and production ready solution, and uncluttered domain code!

          <p>At Wyatt Technology one of our products is used to run workflows during pharmaceutical production. These workflows monitor analytical instruments and control pump hardware, as well as integrating with the rest of the customer's production control system. Our first cut at implementing one of these workflows resulted in a thousand lines of state machine code that was a convoluted mess of nested matches on nested discriminated unions. While some of the code was reusable for other workflows, it was very much not clear how to extract it into a reusable form. Enter free monads and computation expressions. Using this technique we were able create a system of reusable building blocks that make it easy to write understandable workflow code (with dramatically reduced line counts). Error handling, pause/resume, and state saving/restoring is factored out so that it doesn't complicate the workflow code itself. In this workshop I'll show how to create a system of this sort.</p>

I will attempt to connect the future possibilities of realtime data with the fsharp strength in data manipulation. I will also talk about the freedom that WASM brings to front end developers to choose other languages that may be better suited to a task.

          <p>Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that studies how the universe works at the smallest scales.  It has given us technologies like semiconductors, lasers, LEDs, and electron microscopes, and promises even more exciting applications like quantum computing.</p>
          <p>The quantum world is notoriously difficult to understand, since few of our intuitions about physics apply at the subatomic scale.  But not so for functional programmers!  Many of the mathematical ideas that we use to understand the quantum world, like Hilbert space, operators, tensors, and group representations, can all be understood in terms of functions.  In this talk, I'll use familiar concepts like composition, partial application, and currying to make the foundations of the subject clear and show how to solve some basic problems in F#.  At the end, I'll show how these techniques can be used to model a simple quantum computer.</p>
