                <li>How to handle a session in an Elmish application</li>
                <li>How to represent state transition (ex: loadable components)</li>

        abstract: |
          <p>Sometimes it feels like Functional Programmers speak in a different language.
          They use complicated words, arcane math terms, and it isn't immediately obvious why any of what they talk about matters for day-to-day work.
          Here's a talk that tries to address that, and show how FP concepts apply to "normal" programming.</p>
          <p>In this talk, John will walk you through how FP concepts relate to the humble `for` loop, will show you how to use FP building blocks to simplify and strengthen your code, and finally talk about how the art of origami relates to FP.
          There will be <strong>exactly one</strong> slide, at the end of the deck, with traditional FP terminology and scary words - just so you can relate the talk to more advanced material presented elsewhere.
          But otherwise, all jargon used will be familiar to a C#, C++ or Java programmer! That said, this is an intermediate level talk, and quite a few advanced concepts will be disguised in familiar form.</p>

    workshop:
      title: Domain Modeling Made Functional
      time: Wed, Sept. 25th @ 09:00 AM (Workshop)
      abstract: |
        <p>
            Functional programming and domain-driven design might not seem to be a good match, but in fact functional programming can be an excellent approach to designing decoupled, reusable systems with a rich domain model.  This workshop will show you why.
        </p>
        <p>
            This will be a hands-on workshop designed for beginners in F#. We'll do lots of domain modeling exercises starting with some simple models and then enhancing them with constraints, state machines, error handling, commands and events, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll cover these topics in detail:
            <ul>
                <li>The core concepts of functional programming and how they can be applied to Domain Driven Design</li>
                <li>How to represent the nouns and verbs of a domain ("the ubiquitous language") using types.</li>
                <li>Why representing the domain model using types is better than most other documentation (hint: it can never get out of sync)</li>
                <li>How to capture constraints and business rules in the domain model itself instead of being buried in the implementation</li>
                <li>How to represent state transitions</li>
                <li>How to treat errors as a part of the domain</li>
                <li>How to build a complete business workflow from smaller components using composition</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            Do you want to learn F# and Functional Programming? Well, you better start coding! Learning a new programming language is not easy, on top of reading a lot you need to practice even more. This workshop is designed to teach you some of the basics of F# and Functional Programming by combining theory (slides) and practice.
