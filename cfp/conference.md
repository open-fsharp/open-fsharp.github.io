						<h2 class="header-title">SESSION LEVELS</h2>
					</div>
                    <p>Open FSharp aims to have content that is attractive both for beginners, and for experienced F# developers. We will have an equal amount of talks for each. When making your submission, please specify whether you intend this talk to be:</p>
                    <p><strong>“Bunny"</strong>: I expect the audience to have limited knowledge of the language, and will treat them gently. My goal is to give them practical advice, and guide them on their journey to becoming a confident F# developer.</p>
                    <p><strong>“Tiger”</strong>: I don’t plan on explaining language basics, I would like to jump right in advanced techniques that will inspire experienced F# developers to go further, or showcase what can be done stretching the language.</p>
                    <p><strong>“Bear”</strong>: I have a very cool subject I want to present, but it is not F# specific. Although the demo's, code snippets, etc... will be in F#, knowing the language is not very important here.</p>

						<h2 class="header-title">TOPICS</h2>
					</div>
                    <p>Whatever topic you find exciting - we want to hear about it! Of course, it should be F# related. In general, we are looking for talks focusing on practical applications of F#, and how the language can be used to build great solutions.  Not sure what we are looking for? Here are a couple of possible topics:  cross platform development (.NET Core and/or mono), mobile and web applications, Fable, design patterns, and testing.
					Still not sure? Reach out to us at <a href="mailto:cfp@openfsharp.org">cfp@openfsharp.org</a></p>
