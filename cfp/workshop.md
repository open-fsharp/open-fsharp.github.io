					</div>
					<p>In addition to the main conference, Open FSharp will feature a day of paid workshops on
						Wednesday, September 25th. Workshops are instructor lead sessions, intended to give a small
						group of attendees a chance to learn and practice first hand a specific topic.
						<br>
						We will feature two workshop formats:
					</p>
					<p><strong>Deep dive</strong>: People have a basic knowledge of F# and want to dive into a specific
						topic for a full day workshop.</p>
					<p><strong>Taster</strong>: They are not that familiar yet with the topic, but they want a taste of
						what can be done with it.</p>

						<h2 class="header-title">FINANCIALS</h2>
					</div>
					<p>
						Workshop registration will be separate from the main conference. Tickets will cost $425.
						<br>
						Workshop profits will be split equally between the instructor and the conference organization.
						In other words, for each workshop, half of what is left after the venue, food and various costs
						are paid for will go to the speaker, the rest being invested in the conference organization.
						This will be entirely independent from travel support.
						<br>
						If too few people register for a workshop (around 6 attendees), we reserve the right to cancel
						the workshop, rather than run it at a loss. We will do our best to make that decision as early
						as possible, likely around mid July.

						ready. Feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:cfp@openfsharp.org">cfp@openfsharp.org</a> if
