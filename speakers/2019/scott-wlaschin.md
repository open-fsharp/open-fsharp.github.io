                    Functional programming and domain-driven design might not seem to be a good match, but in fact functional programming can be an excellent approach to designing decoupled, reusable systems with a rich domain model.  This workshop will show you why.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will be a hands-on workshop designed for beginners in F#. We'll do lots of domain modeling exercises starting with some simple models and then enhancing them with constraints, state machines, error handling, commands and events, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll cover these topics in detail:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The core concepts of functional programming and how they can be applied to Domain Driven Design</li>
                        <li>How to represent the nouns and verbs of a domain ("the ubiquitous language") using types.</li>
                        <li>Why representing the domain model using types is better than most other documentation (hint: it can never get out of sync)</li>
                        <li>How to capture constraints and business rules in the domain model itself instead of being buried in the implementation</li>
                        <li>How to represent state transitions</li>
                        <li>How to treat errors as a part of the domain</li>
                        <li>How to build a complete business workflow from smaller components using composition</li>
                    </ul>
